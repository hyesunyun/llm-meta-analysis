# Abstract # Abstract ## Background World Health Organization expert groups recommended mortality trials of four repurposed antiviral drugs --- remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon beta-1a --- in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). ## Methods We randomly assigned inpatients with Covid-19 equally between one of the trial drug regimens that was locally available and open control (up to five options, four active and the local standard of care). The intention-to-treat primary analyses examined in-hospital mortality in the four pairwise comparisons of each trial drug and its control (drug available but patient assigned to the same care without that drug). Rate ratios for death were calculated with stratification according to age and status regarding mechanical ventilation at trial entry. ## Results At 405 hospitals in 30 countries, 11,330 adults underwent randomization; 2750 were assigned to receive remdesivir, 954 to hydroxychloroquine, 1411 to lopinavir (without interferon), 2063 to interferon (including 651 to interferon plus lopinavir), and 4088 to no trial drug. Adherence was 94 to 96% midway through treatment, with 2 to 6% crossover. In total, 1253 deaths were reported (median day of death, day 8; interquartile range, 4 to 14). The Kaplan--Meier 28-day mortality was 11.8% (39.0% if the patient was already receiving ventilation at randomization and 9.5% otherwise). Death occurred in 301 of 2743 patients receiving remdesivir and in 303 of 2708 receiving its control (rate ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.11; P=0.50), in 104 of 947 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and in 84 of 906 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.59; P=0.23), in 148 of 1399 patients receiving lopinavir and in 146 of 1372 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.25; P=0.97), and in 243 of 2050 patients receiving interferon and in 216 of 2050 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.39; P=0.11). No drug definitely reduced mortality, overall or in any subgroup, or reduced initiation of ventilation or hospitalization duration. ## Conclusions These remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon regimens had little or no effect on hospitalized patients with Covid-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and duration of hospital stay.

Of these patients, 64 (0.6%) had no, or uncertain, consent to follow-up, which left 11,266 in the intention-to-treat analyses. A total of 2750 patients were assigned to receive remdesivir, 954 to hydroxychloroquine, 1411 to lopinavir (without interferon), 2063 to interferon (including 651 to interferon plus lopinavir), and 4088 to no trial drug ([Figure 1](#)); reporting is 97% complete for those who were entered more than 1 month earlier and 99.7% complete for those who were entered more than 3 months earlier. All 3 patients for whom the diagnosis of Covid-19 was later ruled out were included in the analyses and survived. [Table 1](#) shows patient characteristics: 9120 (81%) were younger than 70 years of age, 6985 (62%) were male, 2768 (25%) had diabetes, 916 (8%) were already receiving ventilation, and 7002 (62%) underwent randomization on days 0 or 1. For each drug, patient characteristics were well balanced by the unstratified 1:1 randomization between it and its control. Deaths were at a median of day 8 (interquartile range, 4 to 14), and discharges were at a median of day 8 (interquartile range, 5 to 12). There were 1253 in-hospital deaths (the primary outcome, including those before and after day 28). The Kaplan--Meier risk of in-hospital death to day 28 was 11.8%; a few in-hospital deaths occurred later. This risk depended on several factors, particularly age (20.4% if ≥70 years and 6.2% if <50 years) and ventilation status (39.0% if the patient was already receiving ventilation and 9.5% otherwise). [Table 1](#) also shows adherence. For remdesivir, the scheduled treatment duration was 10 days (or to death or discharge). Of those assigned to remdesivir, 98% began treatment. Midway through this period, 96% of the patients were still taking it (as compared with only 2% of those in the relevant group). Similarly, for other drugs adherence midway was 94% to 95%, and crossover was 2 to 6%. Trial treatments ceased on schedule (if the patient was still in the hospital). Absolute differences (active vs. control) in the use of glucocorticoids (i.e., corticosteroids) and other nontrial drugs were 0.2 to 3.5 percentage points (Table S2 in the [Supplementary Appendix](#), available at NEJM.org). ## Primary Outcome For each pairwise comparison of a drug and its control, [Figure 2](#) and Figures S1 through S5 show the results of unstratified Kaplan--Meier analyses of in-hospital mortality (with numbers of patients who underwent randomization, in-hospital deaths each week and after day 28, and weekly denominators), along with rate ratios for death stratified according to age and ventilation status; [Figure 3](#) shows the stratified rate ratios according to age and according to ventilation status. No trial drug had any definite effect on mortality, either overall (each P>0.10) or in any subgroup defined according to age, ventilation status at entry, other entry characteristics, geographic region, or glucocorticoid use (Figs. S6 through S9). Death occurred in 301 of 2743 patients receiving remdesivir and in 303 of 2708 receiving its control (rate ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.11; P=0.50), in 104 of 947 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and in 84 of 906 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.59; P=0.23), in 148 of 1399 patients receiving lopinavir and in 146 of 1372 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.25; P=0.97), and in 243 of 2050 patients receiving interferon and in 216 of 2050 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.39; P=0.11). Unstratified comparisons yielded similarly null findings ([Figure 2](#)), as did analyses that excluded patients receiving glucocorticoids and multivariable sensitivity analyses that estimated trial drug effects simultaneously (Table S3). If mechanical ventilation prevented oral administration of lopinavir or other trial drugs, then this could have reduced any effects on mortality of assignment to those drugs, but prespecified analyses of mortality among patients not already receiving ventilation at entry also indicated no definite protective effect of any trial drug ([Figure 3](#)). ## Secondary Outcomes The prespecified secondary outcomes were ventilation and time to discharge. No trial drug reduced the initiation of ventilation among patients not already receiving ventilation. Ventilation was initiated after randomization in 295 patients receiving remdesivir and in 284 receiving its control, in 75 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and in 66 receiving its control, in 126 patients receiving lopinavir and in 121 receiving its control, and in 209 patients receiving interferon and in 210 receiving its control (Table S1). Figure S10 shows the results for the combined outcome of in-hospital death or ventilation initiation. In this open-label trial, patients who would be considered fit for discharge might be kept in the hospital somewhat longer just because they were being given a trial drug, but information on time to recovery can be obtained by comparing the effects of different drugs on time to discharge. Each of the three trial treatments that were scheduled to last more than 7 days increased the percentage of patients remaining in the hospital at day 7 ([Table 1](#)). If one of these three drugs had appreciably accelerated recovery, then the sizes of these effects should have differed, but they did not. Figures S11 through S16 plot time to discharge for all patients, those receiving supplemental oxygen, those not receiving supplemental oxygen, those receiving ventilation, those not receiving ventilation, and those receiving any respiratory support. Each drug delayed discharge by approximately 1 to 3 days while it was being given. Directly randomized comparisons of one trial drug with another (Fig. S17) likewise showed no appreciable differences in discharge rates while both drug regimens continued or after both had ended. The supplementary analyses (Tables S2 and S3) tabulate co-medication (only small absolute differences were found between each trial drug and its control) and provide a multivariable Cox regression fitting all four treatment effects simultaneously (rate ratios for death were similar to those in [Figure 3](#)). The analyses also (in Figs. S1 through S9) subdivide 28-day mortality graphs according to ventilation status at entry and give subgroup analyses of rate ratios for death according to other characteristics and according to glucocorticoid use (with no noteworthy subgroup-specific or geographic variation). All active treatment ended within 14 days, and the numbers of deaths during this 14-day period with any cardiac cause mentioned on the electronic death record were seven with remdesivir and eight with its control, four with hydroxychloroquine and two with its control, six with lopinavir and three with its control, and six with interferon and eight with its control (Fig. S18). Many deaths from Covid-19 involve multiorgan failure, but no death in a patient assigned to a trial drug was attributed specifically by the doctor reporting the death to renal or hepatic disease. ## Meta-Analyses There are four trials that have compared remdesivir with control: the Solidarity trial (604 deaths in 5451 randomly assigned patients), the Adaptive Covid-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-1) (136 deaths in 1062 patients; mortality was a secondary outcome), and two smaller trials (41 deaths).^[6-9](#)^[Figure 4](#) shows the mortality results from each trial, stratified according to initial respiratory support. Within each trial, summation of the observed minus expected numbers of deaths with remdesivir in each stratum led to the stratified rate ratio for death in that trial. Summation of these trial-specific observed-minus-expected subtotals then led to an appropriately weighted average of the results from all trials, which yielded a rate ratio for death (remdesivir vs. control) of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.05).^[5](#)^ Figures S19 and S20 show the mortality results in the trials of hydroxychloroquine (rate ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.21) and of lopinavir (rate ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.13). <figure> <p><img src="" /></p> <figcaption>Information to October 4, 2020, on Trial Entry, Follow-up, and Intention-to-Treat Analyses.<br /> After it was determined which treatments were locally available, random assignment (with equal probability) was between the local standard of care and the available treatments. After the exclusion of 64 of 11,330 patients (0.6%) who had provided either no or uncertain consent regarding follow-up, 11,266 remained in the intention-to-treat analyses. Each pairwise intention-to-treat analysis was between a particular trial drug and its control (i.e., patients who could have been assigned to a particular trial drug but were concurrently assigned to the same care without it).

A total of 64 patients who did not provide clear informed consent
regarding follow-up were excluded. Comparisons are of each trial drug
with concurrent assignment to the same treatment without it. Because the
control groups overlap, the total number (11,266) is less than the sum
of the numbers in the pairwise comparisons. The few patients (always
<0.4%) with a particular characteristic not yet known were merged with
the largest category of that characteristic: 33 were merged with male
sex, 40 were merged with an age of 50 to 69, and 45 were merged with
previous days in the hospital of 2 or more.

Interferon randomization was interferon plus lopinavir as compared with
lopinavir until July 4, 2020, then it was interferon as compared with
the local standard of care.

Shown are any in-hospital deaths, regardless of whether they occurred
before or after day 28 (total, 1253 deaths).

Shown is the Kaplan--Meier 28-day risk of in-hospital death, expressed
as a percentage (overall value, 11.8%). Percentages may not total 100
because of rounding.

Countries in Europe were Albania, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France,
Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, North Macedonia, Norway, Spain,
and Switzerland.

Countries included Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, and Peru.

Countries included Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Kuwait, Lebanon,
Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa.

Percentage of patients (rather than number of patients) is shown for
this variable.

Adherence was calculated only among patients who died or were discharged
alive and was defined as the percentage of patients who were taking the
trial drug midway through its scheduled duration (or midway through the
time from entry to death or discharge, if this was shorter).::::
